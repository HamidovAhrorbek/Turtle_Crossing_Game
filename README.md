🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

This is a classic arcade-style game built using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The objective of the game is to guide the turtle across a busy road filled with moving cars without getting hit. Each time the turtle successfully crosses the road, the game becomes more challenging!


 🚀 Project Overview


*  Language: Python
*  Library: `turtle`
*  Concepts Used:
  *  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  *  Event-driven programming
  *  Collision detection
  *  Game loop mechanics

This project is part of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Angela Yu.


🎮 How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Use the "Up Arrow" key to move the turtle upward.
3. Avoid getting hit by cars.
4. Each time you reach the top safely, the level increases and cars move faster.
5. The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.


🛠 Features

* Randomly generated car positions and colors
* Progressive difficulty with each level
* Scoreboard that displays the current level
* Game over message on collision

🧠 What I Learned

*  How to use the `turtle` module to create animations and handle user input.
*  Managing game state using a main loop.
*  Using OOP to structure game components (Player, CarManager, Scoreboard).
*  Basics of collision detection and screen updates.



🏁 Run the Project

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed and simply run:
